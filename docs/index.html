				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to the homepage of Tensor Network State Package (TNSP), a highly efficient Fortran package for tensor-network-state algorithm!
			</p>
			<p>
				Inspired by the insight of quantum entanglement in the perspective of quantum information theory, a class of wave functions, namely tensor network states (TNS) are proposed to describe the strongly correlated systems. Especially in 2D, the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) and multi-entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) have been proved to be powerful simulation methods to explore the strongly correlated systems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, due to the high computation cost and complexity in coding of TNS algorithm, an easy-to-use tensor network package with high efficienty is still in demand. The Tensor Network State Package (TNSP) is developed to this end. It is built on mature math library(MKL/lapack). While retaining the efficienty of the low level math library, it provides a highly user-friendly interface and a robust error-detecting mechanism. Besides, tensors with abelian symmetry as well as with fermionic commutating rule are fully supported.
